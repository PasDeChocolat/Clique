Clique
======

In making Clique, we wanted to engage visitors as active participants and leave open the possibility for exploring new interactions with other participants. We are interested in understanding and encouraging selfless creativity and collaboration and, with this piece, we are experimenting with the incitation of awareness of self and others in a nonjudgmental space. 

The piece is an interactive audiovisual experience in which participants manipulate a projected visual flow using their motion in the exhibit space. Participants continuously alter the audiovisual composition and leave their mark, at least temporarily, for others to experience and change again.
